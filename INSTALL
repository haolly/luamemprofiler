INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS FOR LINUX:

luamemprofiler has three direct dependencies:

Lua 5.2
http://www.lua.org/work/
Download and Install (make, make install should do it).

SDL 1.2
http://www.libsdl.org/
Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl1.2debian

SDL_ttf 2.0
http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-0

luamemprofiler also depends on FreeMono.ttf font.

Open the Makefile and edit the variables SDL_CFLAGS, SDL_LDFLAGS and LUA_DIR
changing the paths to fit your computer.
Then, open a console, go to the source folder containing the Makefile and type:
make

Then, type "lua5.2 tests/[test_name]" to execute the test.
The output is a memory usage report in the terminal.
Then, type "lua5.2 tests/$test_name $number" to execute the test with graphical
mode on. The report in the first execution should indicate what number you
should use.

Finally, copy the generated file (luamemprofiler.so) to the correct Lua lib
folder.
example: cp luamemprofiler.so /usr/local/lib/lua/5.2/
